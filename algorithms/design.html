<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many useful algorithms have been created and added to program libraries. These include things like math software, ways to search and sort data, generating random numbers, finding patterns in text, and working with data structures like graphs and trees. They also cover network protocols, handling data in distributed systems, and managing computer resources like memory and storage.</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some theoretical ideas have also been turned into practical tools. For example, the RSA encryption system for secure communication, high-quality compilers for programming languages, and designing VLSI circuits for electronic devices.</p>
<br>


<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many steps involved in writing a computer program to solve a given problem. The steps go from problem formulation and specification,where we define the problem and understand it's requierments and constraints; to design of the solution, here we need to find the steps that lead to the requierments;  to implementation, writing the found solution in code; testing and documentation, to keep track of improvements and aid further research; and finally to evaluation of the solution.</p>
<br>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An important aspect of an algorithm is the data it's working on and the way we structure it. Optimal data structures can be choosen by understanding their usefulenss, or in cases where its less obvious, via experimentation. Some special cases might require us to implement custom data structures.</p>
