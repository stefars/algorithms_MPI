<br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Experimentation is a vital part of research, especially when attempting to find the characteristics of an algorithm that is too complex to achieve by known theoretical analysis.
To evaluate the performance, an algorithm can be applied to various test cases.
In the real world testing has gathered information about certain methods such as divide-and-conquer, greedy algorithms, dynamic programming, finite state machine interpreters, stack machine interpreters, heuristic searches, and randomized algorithms.

<br>
Many useful aspects of experimentation are:

    <dt><b>Benchmarking:</b></dt>
    <dd>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>-</b> Performance Testing: Implementing algorithms and running them on different datasets to measure their actual runtime and memory usage.</dd>
    <dd>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>-</b> Comparative Analysis: Comparing the performance of different algorithms for the same problem to determine which is more efficient in practice.</dd>
    
    <dt><b>Simulation:</b></dt>
    <dd>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>-</b> Scenario Testing: Simulating various real-world scenarios to observe how algorithms perform under different conditions.</dd>
    <dd>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>-</b> Stress Testing: Running algorithms under extreme conditions (e.g., large datasets, limited memory) to evaluate their robustness and scalability.</dd>

    <dd>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>-</b> Runtime Profiling: Using tools to analyze which parts of the algorithm consume the most resources during execution.</dd>
