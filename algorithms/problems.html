                Each folder contains the sections mentioned before.

                Each section is a different html file.

<hr style="height:2px;border-width:0;color:black;background-color:black">

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Algorithms and Data Structures addresses day to day problems such as sorting and searching elements in a given data structure. Other problems are presented in Graphs, like finding the shortest paths (Dijkstra's Algorithm)  or detecting cycles. Languages also create the problem of pattern matching ( Knuth-Morris-Pratt Algorithm (KMP)), substring search  and string manipulation. 
Alongside solved problems, there remain the ones that have been too difficulty or we simply lack the technology to solve them:</p>
<br>
<dl>
<dt><b>P vs NP Problem:</b></dt>
<dd> Determine whether every problem whose solution can be verified quickly (in polynomial time) can also be solved quickly (in polynomial time).</dd>
<dd>Example: The Traveling Salesman Problem, Subset Sum Problem. </dd>
<dt><b>Optimization Problems:</b></dt>
<dd>Find the best solution from all feasible solutions.</dd>
<dd>Example: Maximum Flow Problem, Minimum Spanning Tree Problem.</dd>
<dt><b>Data Structure Design:</b></dt>
<dd>Design efficient data structures for specific applications or improve existing ones.</dd>
<dd>Example: Designing data structures for spatial data, dynamic sets, or persistent data.</dd>
<dt><b>Parallel Algorithms:</b></dt>
<dd>Develop efficient algorithms for parallel and distributed computing environments.</dd>
<dd>Example: Parallel Matrix Multiplication, Parallel Sorting Algorithms.</dd>
<dt><b>Approximation Algorithms:</b></dt>
<dd>Find near-optimal solutions to optimization problems in polynomial time.</dd>
<dd>Example: Approximate Traveling Salesman Problem, Approximate Vertex Cover.</dd>
