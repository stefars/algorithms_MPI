                Each folder contains the sections mentioned before.

                Each section is a different html file.

 <p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At UVT, the first experience with Algorithms and Data Structures happens in <b>year I</b>, <b>semester I</b>, where we study the algorithms part of this subject, by implementing numerous algorithms on sorting, but also working with matrixes.
</p><p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In <b>semester II</b> of <b>year I</b>, we get into the Data Structures part, where we study the well known data structures: from linked-lists to binary trees and hash tables.
</p>
<br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In <b>year II</b> we will have the chance to study Advanced Data Structures that will cover structures such as Binomial heaps, Red-Black trees, String matching (which is closely related to FLAT subject).</p>
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In <b>year III</b> a discipline connected to ADS is Data Compression Algorithms.</p>
<br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for <b>Masters</b>, there is no dedicated specialization for ADS. Since this discplinie sits at the foundation of any other specialization, it is inevitably part of all Masters programs.

<h1 class="text-4xl" style="border-bottom: 2px solid black; display: inline-block;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carrer</h1>
</div>
<br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Knowing the relationship between Algorithms and Data Structure with all other fields, there are not many jobs dedicated to this subject in particular apart from researchers or teachers. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main takeaway is that all jobs employ a level of knowledge in ADS since everything in computer science is algorithms and data structures.
